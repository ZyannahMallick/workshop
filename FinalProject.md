## Wicked Problems Final Project

Syria is broken up into 2 administrative subdivisions: adm1 and adm2. Syria has a population of around 17 million and is situated in the Middle East near the Mediterranean coast. There are 14 governates (adm1) regions and 65 districts (adm2). While I focused on Syria as a whole in the begining of my analysis, I looked at Tartus, a district in the Tartus governate, for a more in-depth analysis later on in the semester.
