# Wicked Problems Final Project: Syria

## Political  Subdivisions 

![](syria_politicalsubdivisions.png)

Syria is broken up into 2 administrative subdivisions: adm1 and adm2. Syria has a population of around 17 million and is situated in the Middle East near the Mediterranean coast. There are 14 governates (adm1) regions and 65 districts (adm2). The image above shows Syria broken down into its governates and districts. The text in blue are the names of the governates, which are outlined in red. The districts are outlined in gray and the names of each appear in black.

While I focused on Syria as a whole in the begining of my analysis, I looked at Tartus, a district in the Tartus governate, for a more in-depth analysis later on in the semester.
