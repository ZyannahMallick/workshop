# Project 4: Rendering Topography

## Tartus, Syria 
![](tartus_topo_final_project.png)


The above image is a 3D model of Tartus, Syria. Tartus is an adm2 district that has a population of around 280,000 people. Tartus is situated along the Mediterranean Sea and contains a major port city, which is also called Tartus. Tartus City has a population of around 115,000 people and is also home to a Russian Naval Base. 
  The orange lines on the image represent major roadways throughout Tartus, the red circles represent hospitals in Tartus, and the golden patches represent urban areas. As you can see, all of the 7 hospitals are situated in or near Tartus city. This is most likely due to several factors; it is a heavily populated area, is a major port city so people are constantly coming and going, and is relatively flat compared to the rest of the terrain. While the eastern part of Tartus isn't extremely mountainous, it does have a somewhat mountainous terrain which probably contributes to why the urban areas outisde of Tartus city are located close to a roadway and why Tartus is so heavily populated and very urban. There is also a main road that runs along the coast and through the largest urban area, and all the hospitals are centered around this road as well. 
  Before producing the topography map, I thought that the reason Tartus city was a major port city contributed to why it was so populous. After looking at the topography, I think it plays a part in why the western region of Tartus is so heavily populated since it has a flatter terrain and isn't as rough/harsh as it is in the east.
