Bluemstock believes that big data collected from digital footprints can be analyzed via Machine learning to improve the public health of our nation by identifying those who are in poverty, in need aid after natural disasters, etc. The algorithms identify the "digital signatures of poverty in personal-data from mobile phones". While this would be an ideal way to discover those in need, there are four problems with using such programs: unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and lack of regulation. When solutions are enacted, it is possible that the people who they are intended for don't understand what is happening and will end up being negatively impacted. Because this is such a developing field, tools might not be fully tested and worked through before they are launched and there isn't enough data that supports the accuracy of such algorithms over time. Additionally, the marginalized are less likely to have access to a phone and be able to read/use it, and there is no regulation of this data by the government or aid organizations. Going forward, next steps are too use both digital data and conventional data since some people don't have access to mobile phones, increase collaboration between data scientists,the private sector,the government, and aid organizations. Overall, big data shows promising leads to combat poverty and help those in times of crises but more testing and development needs to occur on these algorithms before they are rolled out.
