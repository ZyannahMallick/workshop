   The Lloyd et al. article introduces an open access archive of 3 and 30 arc-second resolution graded data, put together by 
World Pop. This archive is composed of four raster files: Viewfinder Panoramas using GADM, country IDs, country area, and 
slope layer.  A raster file is a grid of pixels of particular size (resolution) and each pixel has a certain (x,y) value. 
They are used in GIS often because they can represent topography, slope, etc. Input source grids are used to prepare the base
layers, and additional spatial data layers are also incorporated and standardized to match the grid definition and coastlines 
of the country ID.  This approach has a high scale, so the data is analyzed at a higher resolution (100m x 100m). Researchers
also used the areal-weighting method to disaggregate the population from census units into grid cells.
  This method is an improvement to the conventional census because the accuracy of population mapping increases when you 
utilize multiple spatial datasets. It also uses satellite data, which is updated more often and is easier to find. This 
approach will accurately describe human population distributions that can be used to improve global public health issues.
